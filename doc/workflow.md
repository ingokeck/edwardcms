# Workflow

0. load site.yaml file
1. create a site object with pages and posts subobjects.
2. go through the directories, creating a interpret-list of all .md and .html files,
and a copy-list of all other files that should be copied 
3. go through all blog post directories as given in the site.yaml file. These files will be interpreted first. Permalinks for these files are autogenerated. Store meta info in site object
4. go through the interpret-list, loading the yaml frontmatter of all these files and saving it in the site object during that travel that stores the yaml frontmatter
5. copy all files from the copy list to render directory
6. load each file from the interpret-list, move it through the filter-list
and the template machine (mako) and write it out to render directory
7. done
