# edwardcms

A simple and easy to configurate python based CMS for static websites.

# Introduction

Static websites have many advantages over dynamic ones, if you do not need the dynamic setting: They can not get hacked, they are easy to serve for the server, they are cheap to host and they are very resistent to DDoS attacks as even small machines can serve high loads.

A wide variety of static website generaters exist, each of one with its own advantages and disadvantages. Why add a new one to the list? Because I wanted one that is:

* python based
* easy to understand and well documented
* fast
* simple to use
* simple to adjust

# Usage

edward is still in the progress of being written, and while the most basic operations already work, it should not be used right now. Feel free to take a look at the sourcecode if you want.

This page will be updated once edward reaches the state to be tried out.
